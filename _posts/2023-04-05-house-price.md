In my paper writing (as an attachment) research experience, I joined the group guided by Professor Fan Zhang where I had su much fun and learned a lot from this experience. Just like I introduced before, our research is about exploring factors influencing second-hand housing price with a machine learning driven approach. In the group, I assisted in examining factors using a data set of 2799 second-units for sale. Additionally, by using machine learning methods like regression trees and random forests, we analyzed the significance level of factors and plotted the marginal effect diagrams to show the nonlinear relationship between factors and the housing price. Last but not the least, I drafted the suggestions for government about how to better supervise the market according to our heterogeneity test which was made for analyzing how significance level of factors would change under different conditions such as regions, total floors and indoor area.
