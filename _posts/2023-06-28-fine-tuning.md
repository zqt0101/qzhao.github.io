During my research with Song Zhao who is a researcher in Adobe Research, I read a lot of papers about computational methods. For example, in the paper Fine-Tuning Language Models with Just Forward Passes, there is an introduction of the algorithm of MeZO (Memory-efficient Zeroth-order Optimizer), which could be used to optimize large language models with billions of parameters. Additionally, I made a slide about this paper (as an attachment below) for presentation.
