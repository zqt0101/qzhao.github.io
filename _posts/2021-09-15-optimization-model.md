During my intern with Professor Yuhang Liu in Institute of Computing Technology, I attended an academic seminar held by Professor Naihua Xiu in Beijing Jiaotong University Mathematics Department. The seminar is about Naihua Xiuâ€™s research on the application and existing problems of the 0/1 optimization model and the research status quo of data science. I wrote a summary for this seminar (as an attachment).
